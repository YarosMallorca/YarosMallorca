### Interesting facts about me

- I got into programming & computers from an electronics/AV background, inspired by my grandpa, who was an electronics engineer
- My first programming experience was at 11 when I started writing simple `.bat` scripts, then expanded my knowledge with a Python book at 13
- I'm a systemizer, and navigate software & hardware interfaces by muscle memory & patterns instead of labels & icons, to an extreme level
- AI & *vibe coding* hater, turns any codebase into a nightmare over time. Spend a bit more time researching and learning, instead of using AI for everything, future you will thank you :)
- I'm highly interested in FPV drones. In my free time, I build my own quads and help others with troubleshooting in Discord servers
- Played piano since age 5, and played Launchpad for many years, posting YouTube videos
