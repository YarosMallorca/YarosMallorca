I was born in Ukraine in 2006 🇺🇦, and I've been living in Spain since 2012 🇪🇸.

In 2017, I started pursuing my passion and journey to become a software developer.
I am passionate about computer science and enjoy learning new things and technologies!

Coding is awesome, but I also **enjoy self-hosting, system administration, networking, cybersecurity, and electronics** ❤️

### A bit about me

- I got into programming & computers from an electronics & AV background, initially inspired by my grandpa, who was an electronics engineer; I learned AV knowledge as a kid, spending evenings in hotel backstages & at my parents' shows.
- My first programming experience was at 11 when I started writing simple `.bat` scripts, then expanded my knowledge with a Python book at 13.
- I'm a systemizer by trait - navigate software & hardware interfaces by muscle memory & patterns instead of labels & icons, often to a very extreme level.
- Surprisingly, I dislike AI - especially for coding & system administration; it turns any codebase into an unmaintainable mess over time. I would rather spend a bit more time researching and learning instead of using AI for everything.
- I'm highly into FPV, drones, and RC in general. In my free time, I build & fly my own quads, as well as help others with troubleshooting.
- Some other hobbies I had before coding were piano, which I played since age 5, and Launchpad since age 11.
- The last few years I've been very anxious - but I'm still trying to be productive, and do whatever I can to be better at what I do.
